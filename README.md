# SUI-CLI
A small Steam User Info (SUI) for importing game info, from the commandline (CLI)
Currently, you can get all your owned games and sort them by playtime, name or steam order (how it's ordered in-app).
Syntax:
sui-cli <user-id> <api-key> [playtime/name/default]
  
Any pull requests appreciated, especially for cleanliness (code quickly got ugly...)

Future Goals (If I'm not lazy):
- [ ] Config (colors, info displayed)
- [ ] Minimal mode (only game names)
- [ ] Saving API key and such
- [ ] Detailed mode, asking about a specific game
- [ ] Do not require API key if unnecessary

Ideas welcome!
